		<p style="color:#4A60D7 ;margin-left:20px;font-family:Arial"> Hi, I'm Katy. I'm from Seoul, Korea, and is currently a senior in Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio.
		<br>I live in Cartwright with Adjoa (yayy 4 year-roommate).
		<br>I play volleyball, basketball and track.
		<br>I love watching movie with my friends, and sleeping :D</p>

	<h2 style="font-family:arial; color:#222222">Family</h2>	
		<p style="color:#4A60D7 ;margin-left:20px;font-family:arial"> 
		I have two older sisters who are eight years and ten years older than me.
		<br>My father, mother, and my oldest sister are now all living in Seoul, but second oldest sister is living in cincinnati, Ohio.
		<br>Even though we are in the same state, I never got to see her in the states. 
		<br>She is trying to get the international driver lisence, so that she can drive to where I am. I can't wait for her to come visit me!
		<br>My oldest sister used to go to school in Boston when I was young. As I grew, I wanted to study abroad like my sister, so I came!
	<h2 style="font-family:arial; color:#222222">Past Years in the States</h2>
		<p style="color:#4A60D7 ;margin-left:20px;font-family:arial">
		I have been in the states for 2 years. Last year I lived in a city near Seattle with Christine, Ken, and two dogs. 
		<br> They were so nice to me and they greeted me as a family. I sometimes call them and ask them how they are.
		<br> The house was close to the beach, I often went there and picked up some wish-stones. I still have them in Korea.
		<br> I went to St. Mark School which was only took 5 minutes to walk from my house. It's a tiny school that only had nineteen eighth graders including me.
		<br> Since our school was small, everyone was close to each other. I often slept over at my friend's house. 
		<br> I remember that I went trick-or-treat with my friends with the costumes on on Halloween and had a fun night at my friend's house.
		<br> Christine came to pick me up next morning.
		<br> I love to bake and cook, so I went to the market with Christine and got some ingredients and I baked cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and pop-over pancakes.
		<br> I sometimes cooked Korean food for the family, and they really liked it, so I was glad.
