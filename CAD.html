	The task was to design an enclosure for an Arduino Uno.
		<br>
		<br>
	First thing to do was to measure the dimensions of an Ardiuno Uno.
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	Then, I imagined how my UNO case would look like.
	I thought about how the connecting part of the top and bottom would be before I started sketching.
	To help with imagination, I sketched the model with dimensions I wanted on a piece of paper
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="handsketch1.jpg" alt="UNO Sketch" style="width:32%;">
	<img src="handsketch2.jpg" alt="UNO Sketch" style="width:45%;">
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Now, with my sketch on the paper, I actually started sketching on Autodesk Fusion 360.
	I created a sketch for each of the top cover part and the bottom part.
	I have created some holes on the bottom and also some grooves on both sides of the case to make it easier to open the case.
	<br>
	<br>
	This is my final sketch.
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	As you can see, there are a lot of sketch dimentions because I wanted everything to stay in a perfect dimension.
	The program eventually told me I had too many, but I'm not sure why having too many constraints will cause a problem.
	<br>
	<br>
	Using my sketch, I extruded to make it 3-D.
	I used a ruler to help me think of the actually size of the box.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	And here it is, my final 3D model of Arduino UNO case in fusion 360!

        In addition to my Arduino UNO enclosure, I am also working on another project.
        I wanted to make a box, which I can assemble together into a big one box, but also set apart easily.
        	<br>
       	What I came up with was to simply make the box into a lego shape.
