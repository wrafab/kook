		Task
		<hr>
		We were given a bag with 20 spaghetti sticks, 1 yard string, 1 yard tape, and a marshmellow.
		Our task was to build the tallest tower using only the materials given.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Design Ideas and Approach
		<hr>
		<br>
		First, we decided to use a large portion of spaghetti sticks to make the firm base.
		We built a triangle-based tower to use a minimal number of spaghetti sticks.
		On the base, we added a segment that would run across the triangle, which later would hold the spaghetti sticks up top.
		To hold the spaghetti sticks to stand still, we doubled the sticks to make them less flexible, and taped them to the pyramid base.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Failure
		<hr>
		<br>
		However, the marshmellow tower wasn't balanced very well, especially with a marshmellow on top, and soon collapsed.
		I think the problem was that we focused too much on getting the tower high, and not on the support from the bottom.
		The height of the stick in the middle was way higher the supporting pyramid.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Result
		<hr>
		<br>
		This is our result!

		Reflection
		<hr>
		<br>
		Next time, if we get a chance to build it again, I wouldn't have one strand of sticks to put marshmellow on.
