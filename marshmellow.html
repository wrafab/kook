		We were given a bag with 20 spaghetti sticks, 1 yard string, 1 yard tape, and a marshmellow.
		Our task was to build the tallest tower using only the materials given.
		<br>
		<br>
		First, we decided to use a large portion of spaghetti sticks to make the firm base.
		We built a triangle-based tower to use a minimal number of spaghetti sticks.
		On the base, we added a segment that would run across the triangle, which later would hold the spaghetti sticks up top.
		To hold the spaghetti sticks to stand still, we doubled the sticks to make them less flexible, and taped them to the pyramid base.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		This is our result!
